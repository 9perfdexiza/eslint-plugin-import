## Step 1: Install the software
 
To install the software, you need to unzip the downloaded file and run the setup.exe file. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation. You may need to restart your computer after the installation.
 
## Step 2: Connect the servo drive to your computer
 
To connect the servo drive to your computer, you need a USB cable or a RS-232C cable. Plug one end of the cable into the communication port of the servo drive and the other end into the USB port or the serial port of your computer. Make sure that the power supply of the servo drive is turned off before connecting the cable.
 
## Step 3: Launch the software and select the communication port
 
To launch the software, double-click on the MRZJW3-SETUP151E icon on your desktop or in your start menu. The software will open a window with a menu bar and a toolbar. On the menu bar, click on "Communication" and then "Port". A dialog box will appear where you can select the communication port that matches your cable connection. Click on "OK" to confirm.
 
## Step 4: Turn on the power supply of the servo drive and establish communication
 
After selecting the communication port, turn on the power supply of the servo drive. The software will automatically detect the model and version of the servo drive and display it on the status bar at the bottom of the window. If the communication is successful, you will see a green light on the toolbar. If not, you may need to check your cable connection or change your communication settings.
 
## Step 5: Read and write parameters
 
Once you have established communication with the servo drive, you can read and write parameters using the software. On the menu bar, click on "Parameter" and then "Read All" to read all parameters from the servo drive. A dialog box will appear where you can see all parameters grouped by categories. You can also select a specific category or parameter from the tree view on the left side of the dialog box. To write parameters to the servo drive, you can modify any parameter value in the dialog box and then click on "Write All" or "Write Selected" on the menu bar. A confirmation message will appear before writing any parameter.
 
## Step 6: Tune and monitor servo performance
 
Besides reading and writing parameters, you can also use MRZJW3-SETUP151E software to tune and monitor servo performance. On the menu bar, click on "Tuning" and then "Auto Tuning" to perform automatic tuning of servo gain and filter settings. A dialog box will appear where you can select tuning options and start tuning. You can also click on "Manual Tuning" to manually adjust servo gain and filter settings using sliders or buttons. On the menu bar, click on "Monitor" and then "Waveform Monitor" to display servo position, speed, torque, current, and voltage waveforms in real time. A dialog box will appear where you can select waveform channels and start monitoring.
